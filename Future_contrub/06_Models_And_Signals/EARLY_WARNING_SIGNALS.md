# Early Warning Signals

These signals exist to prompt attention, not automation.

---

## Demand Spike Alerts
- Sudden deviation from rolling demand baselines
- Indicates congestion or upcoming shortages

---

## Asset Risk Signals
- Accelerating battery degradation
- Increased maintenance frequency per vehicle

---

## Zone Volatility Flags
- Rising variance in trips or idle time

Accuracy is secondary.
Early awareness is the goal.
