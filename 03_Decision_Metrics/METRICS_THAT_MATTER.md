1. Trips per Zone per Day
What decision does this metric unlock?

Fleet allocation across zones

Zone expansion, contraction, or retirement

Rebalancing frequency and staffing levels

Identification of demand asymmetry across the city

This metric answers:
“Where should we place limited vehicles tomorrow?”

What wrong behavior can this metric cause?

Over-investing in high-volume zones that are already saturated

Ignoring profitability, ride quality, or operational cost

Penalizing emerging zones that are demand-constrained (not demand-poor)

Creating a feedback loop where popular zones get all resources

Failure mode: Optimizing volume instead of value.

Why does this metric survive over time?

Demand concentration is a persistent property of cities

Zones change slowly; human mobility patterns change even slower

Even as products evolve, where people ride remains fundamental

This metric survives because geography always matters.

2. Cost per Successful Trip
What decision does this metric unlock?

Pricing strategy adjustments

Vehicle type ROI comparisons

Cost-control initiatives (maintenance, charging, ops)

Go / no-go decisions for new deployments

This metric answers:
“Are we making money when a customer succeeds?”

What wrong behavior can this metric cause?

Cutting necessary operational costs (maintenance, safety)

Favoring short, low-cost trips over customer value

Discouraging investment in reliability improvements

Masking long-term asset degradation

Failure mode: Optimizing short-term efficiency at the expense of system health.

Why does this metric survive over time?

Every business must eventually answer to unit economics

Even with new revenue models, cost per success remains comparable

This metric scales across geographies and products

This metric survives because economics do not disappear.

3. DSAT (Dissatisfaction) Normalized by Usage
What decision does this metric unlock?

Zone-level quality interventions

Product or ops fixes targeting real pain, not loud minorities

Prioritization of engineering vs operations issues

Customer experience investment decisions

This metric answers:
“Where are we failing customers relative to how much we’re used?”

What wrong behavior can this metric cause?

Ignoring low-usage zones with severe issues

Penalizing high-usage zones unfairly

Overcorrecting for vocal but statistically small complaints

Reducing empathy to a single score

Failure mode: Confusing signal normalization with moral priority.

Why does this metric survive over time?

Raw complaint counts are always misleading

Usage normalization stabilizes comparisons across scale

As platforms grow, relative dissatisfaction matters more than absolute counts

This metric survives because fair comparison requires context.

4. Battery Cycle ROI
What decision does this metric unlock?

Battery replacement timing

Charging strategy optimization

Vehicle design tradeoffs

CapEx vs OpEx planning

This metric answers:
“How much value do we extract from each battery lifecycle?”

What wrong behavior can this metric cause?

Overusing batteries past safe thresholds

Delaying replacements to inflate short-term ROI

Ignoring safety or reliability degradation

Misattributing failures to user behavior

Failure mode: Treating hardware like software.

Why does this metric survive over time?

Physical assets obey physics, not roadmaps

Battery degradation is inevitable and measurable

ROI per cycle is comparable across generations

This metric survives because hardware decay is permanent.

5. Maintenance Rate by Weather
What decision does this metric unlock?

Proactive maintenance scheduling

Weather-adjusted fleet availability

Ops staffing during adverse conditions

Risk mitigation policies

This metric answers:
“How does the environment amplify operational cost?”

What wrong behavior can this metric cause?

Blaming weather for systemic maintenance failures

Overreacting to short-term anomalies

Reducing availability unnecessarily

Masking design flaws behind environmental noise

Failure mode: Treating correlation as inevitability.

Why does this metric survive over time?

Weather variability is constant across years

Climate effects compound rather than disappear

Environmental stress consistently impacts hardware systems

This metric survives because nature always collects its tax.
