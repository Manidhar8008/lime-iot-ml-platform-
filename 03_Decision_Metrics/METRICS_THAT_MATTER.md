## 1. Demand Metrics

**Trips per Hour**
- Measures rider demand intensity
- Used to identify peak vs off-peak windows

**Trips per Vehicle Type**
- Reveals demand skew between scooters and bikes

## 2. Revenue Metrics

**Total Revenue per Hour**
- Captures monetization efficiency by time window

**Average Revenue per Trip**
- Used to compare vehicle economics

**Revenue per Minute**
- Detects long-duration, low-value rides

## 3. Battery & Operational Proxies

**Battery Drain Proxy**
- Estimated as duration × vehicle energy factor
- Used due to missing telemetry

**Revenue per Unit Battery Drain**
- Measures economic efficiency of energy usage


## 4. Decision Thresholds (Illustrative)

- High demand + low revenue → pricing adjustment
- High battery drain + low revenue → fleet policy change
- Scooter-heavy usage → proactive battery ops
