Metrics That Matter

These metrics exist to protect decisions, not to impress dashboards.
Each one survives leadership scrutiny because it exposes trade-offs and risk, not just performance.

1. Trips per Bike per Day
What decision it supports

Fleet sizing decisions

Whether to add, remove, or redeploy vehicles

Capital efficiency evaluation (are assets under- or over-used?)

This metric answers:
“Are we extracting reasonable value from each physical asset?”

What wrong decision it could cause

Pushing bikes into overuse, accelerating wear and failure

Penalizing vehicles in low-demand zones where constraints are external

Optimizing usage at the expense of reliability and customer trust

Failure mode: Treating utilization as free efficiency.

Why it matters long-term

Asset utilization defines ROI for hardware businesses

This metric remains comparable across seasons, cities, and growth stages

Even as demand fluctuates, per-asset productivity remains foundational

This metric survives because hardware economics do not change.

2. Utilization per Zone
What decision it supports

Zone-level fleet allocation

Pricing or incentive experiments

Decisions to expand, shrink, or redesign zones

This metric answers:
“Where does supply consistently meet real demand?”

What wrong decision it could cause

Starving emerging zones that are demand-constrained, not demand-poor

Over-investing in saturated zones with diminishing returns

Ignoring regulatory or environmental constraints behind low utilization

Failure mode: Confusing low utilization with low opportunity.

Why it matters long-term

Spatial demand imbalance is persistent in cities

Zone-level utilization reveals structural, not temporary, patterns

It scales as the business expands geographically

This metric survives because cities are uneven by nature.

3. Idle Time
What decision it supports

Rebalancing frequency and strategy

Ops staffing schedules

Identification of supply–demand mismatch

This metric answers:
“Where are assets waiting instead of working?”

What wrong decision it could cause

Overcorrecting by flooding zones with too many vehicles

Misinterpreting necessary idle time as inefficiency

Ignoring that some idle time is required for availability and resilience

Failure mode: Treating zero idle time as optimal.

Why it matters long-term

Idle time reflects system friction, not just demand

It exposes inefficiencies before revenue drops

It is a leading indicator of misallocation

This metric survives because waste always precedes loss.

4. Demand Volatility
What decision it supports

Forecast confidence levels

Risk buffers in fleet and staffing

Policy for surge vs steady-state operations

This metric answers:
“How predictable is demand in this system?”

What wrong decision it could cause

Overbuilding capacity for rare spikes

Underpreparing for highly volatile zones or seasons

Treating volatility as noise instead of risk

Failure mode: Optimizing for averages in unstable systems.

Why it matters long-term

Volatility determines how safely decisions can be automated

High volatility increases the cost of being wrong

Stable growth depends on understanding variability, not just trends

This metric survives because uncertainty never disappears.

5. Weather-Adjusted Demand
What decision it supports

Accurate demand forecasting

Fair performance evaluation across time periods

Operational readiness under adverse conditions

This metric answers:
“What demand would exist if conditions were neutral?”

What wrong decision it could cause

Masking product or ops issues behind weather normalization

Overconfidence in adjusted forecasts

Ignoring that weather itself is a real customer constraint

Failure mode: Explaining away reality instead of accounting for it.

Why it matters long-term

Weather effects repeat annually but vary in intensity

Adjusted demand enables apples-to-apples comparisons

It separates controllable decisions from uncontrollable forces

This metric survives because environmental pressure is permanent.

Final Principle

A metric is valuable only if it can be misused
—and still defended.

These metrics matter because they force leadership to confront:

trade-offs

risk

and second-order effects

Not just performance.
