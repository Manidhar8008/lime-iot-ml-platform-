DATA CONTRACT — Lime Micromobility Decision Dataset
Purpose

This data contract defines the canonical structure, semantics, and assumptions of the core trip-level dataset (lime_final.csv) used across analytics, metrics, and decision scenarios in this repository.

The goal is not descriptive reporting, but decision enablement.

1. Dataset Overview

Granularity: One row = one completed trip

Primary Entity: Trip

Source: Public micromobility e-scooter trip data

Row Count: ~200,000 sampled trips

Geography: City-level (Chicago)

Time Coverage: Multi-month historical sample

2. Entity Model

4. Explicit Assumptions (Important)

Vehicle-level telemetry (vehicle_id, battery %) is not available

Battery health and fleet efficiency are inferred via behavioral proxies

Pricing model is simplified to enable comparative analysis

Dataset is designed for relative insights, not accounting-grade precision

5. Decisions This Dataset Enables

Identify demand concentration risk

Detect pricing inefficiencies

Highlight operationally volatile zones

Surface abnormal trip behavior

Prioritize areas for deeper telemetry investment

6. Known Gaps & Future Data Requirements

To move from inference to diagnosis, the following data is required:

Vehicle-level identifiers

Battery telemetry (start %, end %)

Maintenance and downtime logs

Deployment & rebalancing events

This contract is the single source of truth for all downstream analysis.
