# Dashboard Prototype

This dashboard is a lightweight prototype intended for stakeholder review.

It demonstrates how decision outputs can be consumed visually without
requiring access to code, notebooks, or BI tools.

The dashboard is static by design and reflects the current decision logic
and data contracts defined in the system.
