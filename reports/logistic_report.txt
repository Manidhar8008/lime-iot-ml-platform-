MODEL: Logistic Regression
PURPOSE: Primary risk scoring model

Evaluation Context
------------------
Decision Grain: Trip-level
Positive Class: High intervention risk
Business Priority: High recall (missing risk is costlier than false alerts)

Performance Summary
-------------------
Accuracy: ~0.96 – 0.97
Recall (Risk = 1): High (≈ 1.0)
ROC AUC: ~0.99

Interpretation
--------------
Logistic Regression performs strongly as an early warning system.
The model prioritizes recall, ensuring that risky trips and assets
are rarely missed, even at the cost of investigating some false positives.

This behavior aligns well with operational use cases where proactive
maintenance and intervention reduce downstream costs.

Operational Role
----------------
- Primary risk scoring engine
- Used to rank trips and assets by intervention priority
- Feeds downstream decision logic rather than triggering actions directly

Limitations
-----------
- Less interpretable than rule-based models
- Requires thresholding and business rules for final decisions
