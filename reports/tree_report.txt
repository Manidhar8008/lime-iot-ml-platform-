MODEL: Decision Tree
PURPOSE: Explainability and policy validation model

Evaluation Context
------------------
Decision Grain: Trip-level
Positive Class: High intervention risk
Business Priority: Interpretability and rule clarity

Performance Summary
-------------------
Accuracy: ~0.98
Recall (Risk = 1): Moderate (~0.71)
ROC AUC: ~0.86

Interpretation
--------------
The Decision Tree model provides transparent, rule-based decisions
that are easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders.

While its recall is lower than Logistic Regression, it highlights
clear thresholds and dominant drivers of risk, making it valuable
for validating whether model logic aligns with operational intuition.

Operational Role
----------------
- Supporting explainability model
- Used to communicate drivers of risk
- Helps validate and challenge decision rules

Limitations
-----------
- Misses some early risk signals
- Not suitable as a standalone risk detector
