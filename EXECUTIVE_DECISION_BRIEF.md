What This System Does

This system helps operations teams identify where attention is needed next, before asset issues escalate into revenue loss or downtime.

It does not replace human judgment.
It prioritizes attention under uncertainty.

How Risk Is Interpreted

A higher risk score means:

The asset shows early warning signs of stress

Multiple signals align (health, usage, environment)

Preventive action may reduce downstream cost

A lower risk score means:

No immediate indicators of concern

Continued operation is reasonable

Confidence Levels

Each recommendation includes a confidence level:

High confidence

Sufficient data history

Multiple stable signals agree

Stronger interventions are acceptable

Medium confidence

Partial signal agreement

Suggests inspection or monitoring

Low confidence

Insufficient or unstable data

System avoids aggressive actions

This prevents overreaction to noisy or incomplete data.

Why Some Signals Are Down-Weighted

Certain indicators (e.g., short-term battery trends) can be noisy.

Rather than forcing decisions:

The system reduces their influence when reliability is low

Stable signals (usage, zone pressure) remain active

Decisions become more conservative under uncertainty

This design choice reduces unnecessary interventions.

What Leadership Should Trust

Leadership can trust that:

The system is conservative by default

Uncertainty is explicitly handled, not hidden

Recommendations are reversible and auditable

The system is designed to support judgment, not override it.

What This Enables

Smarter maintenance planning

Reduced surprise failures

Better allocation of operational effort

Clear audit trail for decisions
