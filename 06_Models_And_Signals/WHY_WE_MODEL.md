# Why We Model

Forecasting exists to reduce uncertainty, not eliminate it.

Models help answer:
- Where risk is increasing
- Which decisions require buffers
- When human judgment should intervene

When models are wrong:
- The cost of overconfidence exceeds the cost of inaction

Simple models outperform complex ones here because:
- Demand drivers are structural
- Interpretability matters more than precision
- Failure modes must be obvious
