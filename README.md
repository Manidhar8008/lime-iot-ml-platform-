Why This Exists (Business Context)

 What decisions were delayed or wrong in micromobility ops?
-  Under maintenance, Stolen vehicles, Showing Wrong location within the application (faulty UI),  Gps drift.
  
What happens Or when iot data is Late or Messy?
-  Dsat's,  Customer retention,  Leads to 11 year Ross For business as we cannot deliver the Product satisfaction,  Misleading signals,  Wrong Kpi's and matrix,
  
Who suffers first?
-  Customers,  Frontline agents,  Ops and local ops,  Stakeholders,  Leadership.
  
Why dashboards alone were not useful
-  They don’t Share feelings,  Do not answer the exact Business problem,  Do not predict signals,  Cannot control outliers.
  

Decisions This Platform Enables

- Where does a business lose most money ( Zone, area, biketype)
-  When does the maintenance spike ( Weather, battery, location)
-  Categorised fraud users by levels ( User type, area,zones)
-  How does dsat Trigger in the first place rootcause ( rider details, User details)
-  Other reasons for mass and most trip fails
-  What are the area the business is losing And earning ( Zones, cities, no of trips per km,  Comparison for ¼ year)
-  What is a lifespan of vehicle ( Predictive) graphed by ( City,  Weather,  Usage, )

From Raw Signals to Trusted Decisions

 Raw IOT data --  Clean multiple data sets for different approaches for problem --  Finding multiple metrics -- analysing within metrics finding the root cause and prediction(later in ML) --  Showing how bottleneck affect revenue --  Making decision for overall P&L (business)

Business Impact

This platform is designed to shift micromobility operations from reactive firefighting to proactive decision-making.

Earlier Intervention:
 - Enabled teams to identify demand spikes, maintenance risks, and SLA-impacting issues earlier, before they escalated into customer-facing problems.


Reduced Operational Blind Spots:
 - Converted noisy and unreliable IoT signals into trusted datasets, reducing dependence on manual checks, escalations, and intuition-driven decisions.


Improved Decision Confidence:
 - Provided leadership and operations teams with consistent metrics and predictive signals, improving confidence in fleet planning, zone prioritization, and resource allocation.


Lower Reactive Load on Frontline Teams:
-  By surfacing root causes and patterns behind failures (DSAT, trip failures, maintenance spikes), the system reduces repeated escalations and reactive workload.


Foundation for Scalable Optimization:
 - Established reliable data foundations that allow analytics and ML models to operate on clean, validated data—making future optimization safer and more scalable
