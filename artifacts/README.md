# Visualization Artifacts — Decision Support

These visual artifacts are designed to support operational
decision-making, not exploratory analysis.

Each visualization answers a specific business question
and directly ties to a recommended action in the decision table.

Visuals are generated from decision-ready data only.
Raw and exploratory plots are intentionally excluded.
