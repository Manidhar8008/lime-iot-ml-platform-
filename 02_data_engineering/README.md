Purpose
Data cleaning, validation, and feature engineering code used to transform raw telemetry into analysis-ready tables.

What belongs here
- Transformation functions and small utilities (cleaning, validation, feature extraction)
- Schemas and small example fixtures for shape expectations

Acceptance criteria
- Each module exposes a small, testable function (example: clean_locations(df)) with docstrings and a unit test.

TODO
- Audit src/ and migrate cleaning/feature functions here one file at a time.
