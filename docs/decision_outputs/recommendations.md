Business Recommendations

The following recommendations illustrate how analytical insights and predictive signals
can be translated into practical operational actions.

1. Introduce time-based fleet rebalancing
Instead of static redistribution, prioritize rebalancing around known peak demand windows.
This can reduce lost rides without increasing fleet size.

2. Focus interventions on high-variance zones
Zones with unpredictable demand should receive closer monitoring and faster response,
as they contribute disproportionately to service instability.

3. Treat short-trip clusters as operational signals
Repeated short trips should trigger operational review rather than being dismissed as noise.
These patterns may indicate friction in the user experience.

4. Adjust strategies for weekday vs weekend usage
Operational and pricing strategies should account for differing user behavior across the week.
Applying the same assumptions leads to missed optimization opportunities.

5. Use predictive signals as early warnings, not guarantees
Forecasts should inform prioritization and preparedness, not replace human judgment.
Even simple models can provide value when used to reduce decision latency.
