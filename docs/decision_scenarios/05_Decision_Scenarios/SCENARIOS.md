Idle time and volatility showed peak saturation risk.

**What decision should change**  
Shift from maximizing utilization to balancing availability.

**What leadership believed**  
Lower trips indicated declining user experience.

**What data corrected**  
Weather-adjusted demand showed suppression, not dissatisfaction.

**What decision should change**  
Plan capacity dynamically instead of changing product strategy.

## Scenario 3 — Maintenance Costs Seen as Inefficiency

**What leadership believed**  
Rising maintenance signaled poor operational execution.
