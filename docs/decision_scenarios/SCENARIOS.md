Scenario 1 — Demand Collapse Misdiagnosed as Product Failure

What leadership observed
Trips per zone dropped sharply over several days in multiple high-volume zones.

What they assumed
The product experience had degraded (vehicle quality or app issues), causing users to stop riding.

Why that assumption was risky
It pushed leadership toward costly product or hardware changes without validating whether demand decline was controllable or external.

What data showed instead
Weather-normalized demand revealed heavy rainfall and temperature drops aligned precisely with the decline, while DSAT normalized by usage remained stable.

What decision should change
Shift from reactive product investment to weather-adjusted demand forecasting and proactive ops planning, avoiding unnecessary hardware or app changes.

Scenario 2 — Rising Costs Blamed on Maintenance Inefficiency

What leadership observed
Cost per successful trip increased quarter-over-quarter.

What they assumed
Maintenance teams were inefficient or over-servicing vehicles.

Why that assumption was risky
Cost-cutting maintenance risks compounding failures, safety incidents, and long-term asset loss.

What data showed instead
Battery cycle ROI analysis showed vehicles were operating beyond optimal battery lifecycle thresholds, increasing failure rates and maintenance events — especially under adverse weather conditions.

What decision should change
Move from maintenance cost reduction to earlier battery replacement and lifecycle-based asset planning, accepting short-term cost increases to stabilize long-term unit economics.

Scenario 3 — High Complaints Interpreted as Poor Zone Performance

What leadership observed
Certain zones had the highest absolute number of customer complaints.

What they assumed
Those zones were operationally broken and required immediate intervention or downsizing.

Why that assumption was risky
High-usage zones naturally generate more complaints; acting on raw counts penalizes success and misallocates resources.

What data showed instead
DSAT normalized by usage showed these zones performed better than average, while lower-usage zones had disproportionately high dissatisfaction rates.

What decision should change
Redirect operational focus from high-volume zones to low-usage, high-friction zones, preserving revenue while improving overall customer experience.
