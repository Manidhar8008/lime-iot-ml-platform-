# What the Data Shows

This section explains **patterns that change decisions**.
Charts exist only to validate these explanations.

## 1. Demand Concentration Hides Risk

High-demand periods and locations create the illusion of stability.
In reality, a small number of time windows account for a disproportionate share of trips.

This creates hidden risk:
- Small disruptions during peak windows cause outsized impact
- Systems optimized for averages fail during concentration spikes

**Insight:** Volume does not equal resilience.

## 2. Averages Lie; Variance Predicts Failure

Average demand appears stable across days.
Variance reveals a different story.

High-variance periods:
- Increase forecasting error
- Amplify operational stress
- Make reactive decisions more costly

**Insight:** Instability is a better risk signal than growth.

## 3. Weather Amplifies Weak Zones

Weather does not affect all zones equally.
Zones with marginal utilization experience disproportionate drops under adverse conditions.

This indicates:
- Structural fragility, not temporary suppression
- Weather acts as a stress test, not a root cause

**Insight:** Weather exposes weak operational design.

## 4. Idle Time Is a Misallocation Signal, Not Waste

Idle time clusters spatially and temporally.
This reflects mismatched supply placement, not unused demand.

Eliminating idle time entirely would reduce availability and increase customer friction.

**Insight:** Some inefficiency is required for reliability.

## 5. Volatility Precedes Revenue Decline

Periods of rising demand volatility consistently appear before sustained drops in usage.

This suggests volatility is an **early warning signal**, not noise.

**Insight:** Instability shows up before losses do.
