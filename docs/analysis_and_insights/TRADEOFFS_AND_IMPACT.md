## 1. Optimizing Utilization vs Customer Wait Time

Higher utilization improves asset ROI.
Excessive utilization reduces availability and increases wait times.

**Tradeoff:** Efficiency vs reliability  
**Impact:** Over-optimization increases churn before it increases profit.

## 2. Expanding Fleet vs Maintenance Cost

Adding vehicles reduces scarcity and idle time pressure.
More assets increase maintenance, charging, and capital exposure.

**Tradeoff:** Growth vs operational complexity  
**Impact:** Growth without lifecycle planning destroys margins.

## 3. Predicting Demand vs Reacting to Spikes

Forecasting enables proactive planning.
Forecasts are wrong during volatile conditions.

## 4. Normalizing for Weather vs Accepting Reality

Weather-adjusted metrics enable fair comparison.
Weather is a real customer constraint, not just noise.
