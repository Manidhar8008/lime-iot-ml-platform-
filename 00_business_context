Business Context – Why This Project Exists

Problem
Micromobility operations generate large volumes of telemetry data, but decision-making is often reactive.
Teams typically see issues only after customer impact or operational failure.

This project exists to demonstrate how raw operational data can be transformed into:
- Clear situational awareness
- Early signals of potential issues
- Inputs that support better planning and intervention

Stakeholders
- Operations teams managing fleet availability
- Product teams monitoring usage patterns
- Business leaders responsible for efficiency and customer experience

Success Criteria
- Data can be understood without deep technical context
- Insights arrive early enough to influence decisions
- Outputs reduce reliance on manual investigation and guesswork

Notes
This is a proof-of-concept intended to demonstrate thinking and structure rather than production scale.
