Purpose
Model training, validation, and small scripts that produce forecasts used in demos.

What belongs here
- Training scripts (train.py), model evaluation code, and model-serving stubs (prediction entrypoints)
- Saved small model artifacts used in demos (kept small and checked into data/ if necessary)

Acceptance criteria
- A training script that runs on sample data and outputs a small model file (for demo).
- Clear entrypoint for prediction (documented).

TODO
- Review predictor.py and plan a one-file-at-a-time migration into this folder.
