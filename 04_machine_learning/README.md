Machine Learning – Anticipating What May Happen

Purpose
This folder contains modeling code used to generate predictive signals from historical micromobility data.

The goal of this layer is anticipation, not automation:
- Estimate near-term trends
- Highlight potential risk areas
- Support human decision-making with signals, not guarantees

What lives here
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Prediction or forecasting entry points
- Supporting code used to generate model outputs for demos

How this is used
Models in this folder consume clean, engineered data.
Their outputs are passed to the decision layer, where they are interpreted and acted upon.

Notes
Models are intentionally simple and interpretable.
The focus is on usefulness and reliability rather than maximizing accuracy.
