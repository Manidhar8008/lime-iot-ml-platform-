Analytics Layer – Understanding What Is Happening

Purpose
This folder contains exploratory analysis and visualizations that help explain how micromobility usage behaves across time and location.

The goal of this layer is not prediction, but understanding:
- When demand increases or drops
- Which zones are over- or under-utilized
- Patterns that indicate operational inefficiencies

What lives here
- Scripts and notebooks that generate charts and summary statistics
- Lightweight KPI calculations used by operations and product teams
- Visual analysis used to support business discussions

How this is used
Insights from this layer help teams:
- Identify peak demand windows
- Spot consistently under-performing zones
- Decide where deeper investigation or intervention is needed

Notes
This analysis operates on cleaned, analytics-ready data produced by the data engineering layer.
It intentionally avoids complex modeling and focuses on clarity and interpretability.
