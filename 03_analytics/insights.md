Key Analytical Insights

These insights are derived from exploratory analysis of micromobility trip and telemetry data.
They are written from an operational perspective rather than a purely statistical one.

1. Demand is highly time-dependent
Usage consistently peaks during specific hours of the day, indicating commuter-driven behavior rather than random usage.
This suggests that static fleet placement is inefficient during peak windows.

2. Zone utilization is uneven
A small number of zones account for a disproportionate share of trips, while others remain consistently under-utilized.
This points to opportunities for rebalancing and potential over-supply in low-activity areas.

3. Short trips cluster in specific locations
Clusters of unusually short trips may indicate parking issues, unlock failures, or poor vehicle placement.
These areas warrant deeper operational investigation rather than marketing intervention.

4. Weekday and weekend patterns differ
Usage patterns shift noticeably between weekdays and weekends, implying different user intent and demand drivers.
Operational strategies should adapt to these differences instead of applying a single policy.

5. Variability matters more than averages
Some zones show stable demand while others are highly volatile.
High-variance zones introduce planning risk and benefit most from predictive monitoring.
