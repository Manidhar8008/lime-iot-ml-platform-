What leadership thinks the problem is

“Demand is low”

“Maintenance costs are high”

“Users are unhappy”

What the problem actually is

Wrong signals

Late signals

Messy IoT data causing false KPIs

Why dashboards failed

They show trends, not causes

They hide variance and outliers

They don’t answer “what breaks if we do nothing”

What a wrong decision looks like

Expanding fleet in wrong zones

Cutting maintenance in high-risk areas

Blaming users instead of ops constraints
